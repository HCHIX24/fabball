# Bouncing Floating Action Button (FAB)

This project features a **bouncing Floating Action Button (FAB)** that moves around the screen, changing direction upon hitting the window edges. It's a simple yet fun implementation using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- A floating button that moves continuously.
- Collision detection with window edges.
- Smooth bouncing effect.
- Minimalistic design.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. The button's position is initialized randomly.
2. It moves with a set velocity in both **X** and **Y** directions.
3. If it collides with the edges of the window, it reverses direction.
4. The movement updates every **20 milliseconds** using `setInterval()`.
